Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::BaseVariationFeatureOverlap

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::BaseVariationFeatureOverlap;

    my $bvfo = Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::BaseVariationFeatureOverlap->new(
        -feature                => $feature,
        -base_variation_feature => $var_feat
    );

    print "consequence type: ", (join ",", @{ $bvfo->consequence_type }), "\n";
    print "most severe consequence: ", $bvfo->display_consequence, "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A BaseVariationFeatureOverlap represents a BaseVariationFeature which is in close
proximity to another Ensembl Feature. It is the superclass of variation feature
specific classes such as VariationFeatureOverlap and StructuralVariationOverlap
and has methods common to all such objects. You will not normally instantiate this
class directly, instead instantiating one of the more specific subclasses.
