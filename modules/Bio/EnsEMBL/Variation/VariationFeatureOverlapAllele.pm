Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::VariationFeatureOverlapAllele

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::VariationFeatureOverlapAllele;
    
    my $vfoa = Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::VariationFeatureOverlapAllele->new(
        -variation_feature_overlap  => $vfo,
        -variation_feature_seq      => 'A',
        -is_reference               => 0,
        -allele_number              => 1,
    );

    print "sequence with respect to the feature: ", $vfoa->feature_seq, "\n";
    print "sequence with respect to the variation feature: ", $vfoa->variation_feature_seq, "\n";
    print "consequence SO terms: ", (join ",", map { $_->SO_term } @{ $vfoa->get_all_OverlapConsequences }), "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A VariationFeatureOverlapAllele object represents a single allele of a 
VariationFeatureOverlap. It is the super-class of various feature-specific allele
classes such as TranscriptVariationAllele and RegulatoryFeatureVariationAllele and 
contains methods not specific to any particular feature type. Ordinarily you will 
not create these objects yourself, but instead you would create e.g. a 
TranscriptVariation object which will then create VariationFeatureOverlapAlleles 
based on the allele string of the associated VariationFeature.
