=head1 NAME

  Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::Pipeline::VariantQC::UnmappedVariant

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module extracts a list of ids for variations without a mapped location on the currents genomic sequence and enters them in the failed variation table.
It is run as a seperate independant process alongside the main variant QC
