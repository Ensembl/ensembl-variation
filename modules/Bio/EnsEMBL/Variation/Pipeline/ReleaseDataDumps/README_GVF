This directory contains gzip compressed GVF (Genome Variation Format) files: 

    %s.gvf.gz 
        All germline variations from the current Ensembl release for this
        species
    %s_structural_variations.gvf.gz
        All structural variations (if available for this species)
    %s_failed.gvf.gz
        Any variations that have been failed by the Ensembl QC checks
    %s_incl_consequences.gvf.gz
        All consequences of the variations on the Ensembl transcriptome,
        as called by the variation consequence pipeline

For human only:
    Homo_sapiens_somatic.gvf.gz
        All somatic mutations from the current Ensembl release.
    Homo_sapiens_somatic_incl_consequences.gvf.gz
        All consequences of somatic mutations on the Ensembl transcriptome,
        as called by the variation consequence pipeline
    Homo_sapiens_phenotype_associated.gvf.gz
        All variations from the current Ensembl release that have been
        associated with a phenotype
    Homo_sapiens_clinically_associated.gvf.gz
        All variations from the current Ensembl release that have been
        described by ClinVar as being probable-pathogenic, pathogenic,
        drug-response or histocompatibility

Additionally, we provide for human:
    - files with germline variations observed in the Watson and Venter
      genomes along with their genotypes
    - files containing allele frequencies from several of the HapMap,
      1000 genomes phase 1 populations and from populations from the
      Exome Sequencing Project

If available for this species, the file includes information on:
    - ancestral_allele
    - evidence
    - clinical_significance
    - global minor allele, frequency and count
Incl_consequences files include sift (if available for this species)
and polyphen (human only) predictions.


Please note that depending on the amount of variation data available for this
species the uncompressed file may be very large (e.g. the entire germline file
for human is ~3GB and the file including consequences is ~10GB).

The data contained in these files is presented in GVF format, this is a
simple tab-delimited format derived from GFF3 which shows the location of
each variant along with the reference and variant sequences, an identifier
for the source of the data (typically a dbSNP rsID), and other relevant
information (e.g. genotypes, allele frequencies, the predicted effect of
this variant on a transcript), a short example is presented below. For
more details about GVF please refer to:
