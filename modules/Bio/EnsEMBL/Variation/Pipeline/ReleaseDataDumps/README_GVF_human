This directory contains gzip compressed GVF (Genome Variation Format) files: 

    From release/93 we dump data per chromosome (1-22, MT, X, Y) for:
    homo_sapiens-chr*.gvf.gz 
        All germline variations from the current Ensembl release for this
        species
    homo_sapiens_incl_consequences-chr*.gvf.gz
        All consequences of the variations on the Ensembl transcriptome,
        as called by the variation consequence pipeline

    homo_sapiens_structural_variations.gvf.gz
        All structural variations (if available for this species)
    homo_sapiens_failed.gvf.gz
        Any variations that have been failed by the Ensembl QC checks
    homo_sapiens_somatic.gvf.gz
        All somatic mutations from the current Ensembl release.
    homo_sapiens_somatic_incl_consequences.gvf.gz
        All consequences of somatic mutations on the Ensembl transcriptome,
        as called by the variation consequence pipeline
    homo_sapiens_phenotype_associated.gvf.gz
        All variations from the current Ensembl release that have been
        associated with a phenotype
    homo_sapiens_clinically_associated.gvf.gz
        All variations from the current Ensembl release that have been
        described by ClinVar as being probable-pathogenic, pathogenic,
        drug-response or histocompatibility

Additionally, we provide for human:
    - 1000GENOMES-phase_3.gvf.gz containing allele frequencies from 1000
      genomes phase 3 populations
    - NOTE:
        - files containing allele frequencies from several of the HapMap
          populations have been discontinued and are available from our archive sites,
          the latest being ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-97/variation/gvf/homo_sapiens/
        - files containing allele frequencies from populations from the
          Exome Sequencing Project have been discontinued and are available
          from our archive sites, the latest being ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-98/variation/gvf/homo_sapiens/

If available for this species, the file includes information on:
    - ancestral_allele
    - evidence
    - clinical_significance
    - global minor allele, frequency and count
Incl_consequences files include sift (if available for this species)
and polyphen (human only) predictions.


The data contained in these files is presented in GVF format, this is a
simple tab-delimited format derived from GFF3 which shows the location of
each variant along with the reference and variant sequences, an identifier
for the source of the data (typically a dbSNP rsID), and other relevant
information (e.g. genotypes, allele frequencies, the predicted effect of
this variant on a transcript), a short example is presented below. For
more details about GVF please refer to:

We use the sum command for calculating checksums.
