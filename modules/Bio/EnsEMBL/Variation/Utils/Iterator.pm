=head1 NAME

  Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::Utils::Iterator

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $variation_iterator = $variation_adaptor->fetch_iterator_by_VariationSet($1kg_set);

  while (my $variation = $variation_iterator->next) {
    # operate on variation object
    print $variation->name, "\n";
  }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

  Some adaptor methods may return more objects than can fit in memory at once, in these cases 
  you can fetch an iterator object instead of the usual list reference. The iterator object 
  allows you to iterate over the set of objects (using the next() method) without loading the
  entire set into memory at once. The number of objects that are fetched and stored in memory
  can be controlled with the cache_size parameter to the the constructor.

=head2 new

  Arg 1 : a coderef representing the iterator, this anonymous subroutine
          is assumed to return the next object in the set when called,
          and to return undef when the set is exhausted

  Example    :

    my $iterator = Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::Utils::Iterator->new(
        sub { return $self->fetch_by_dbID(shift @dbIDs) }
    );

  Description: Constructor, creates a new iterator object
  Returntype : Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::Utils::Iterator
  Exceptions : dies if the supplied argument is not a coderef
  Caller     : general
  Status     : Experimental

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;

    my $coderef = shift;

    die "The supplied argument does not look like an anonymous subroutine"
        unless ref $coderef eq 'CODE';

    my $self = {sub => $coderef};

    return bless $self, $class;
}

=head2 next

  Example    : $obj = $iterator->next()
  Description: returns the next object from this iterator, or undef if the iterator is exhausted
  Returntype : object reference (the type will depend on what this iterator is iterating over)
  Exceptions : none
  Caller     : general
  Status     : Experimental

=cut


sub next {
    my $self = shift;

    # if someone has called has_next, there might be a cached value we can return

    if ($self->{next}) {
        return delete $self->{next};
    }
    else {
        return $self->{sub}->();
    }
}

=head2 has_next

  Example    : if ($iterator->has_next) { my $obj = $iterator->next }
  Description: returns true if this iterator has more objects to fetch, false when it is exhausted
  Returntype : boolean
  Exceptions : none
  Caller     : general
  Status     : Experimental

=cut
