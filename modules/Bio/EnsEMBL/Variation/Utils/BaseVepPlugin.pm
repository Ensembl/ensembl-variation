Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::Utils::BaseVepPlugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package FunkyPlugin;

    use base qw(Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::Utils::BaseVepPlugin);
    
    sub feature_types {
        return ['Transcript'];
    }

    sub get_header_info {
        return {
            FUNKY_PLUGIN => "Description of funky plugin"
        };
    }

    sub run {
        my ($self, $transcript_variation_allele) = @_;

        my $results = ... # do analysis

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To make writing plugin modules for the VEP easier, get 
your plugin to inherit from this class, override (at least)
the feature_types, get_header_info and run methods to behave
according to the documentation below, and then run the VEP
with your plugin using the --plugin <module name> command
line option.

  Arg[1]     : An instance of a subclass of Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::BaseVariationFeatureOverlapAllele
  Arg[2]     : A hashref containing all the data that will be printed on this line, keyed by column name
  Description: Run this plugin, this is where most of the plugin logic should reside. 
               When the VEP is about to finish one line of output (for a given variation-allele-feature 
               combination) it will call this method, passing it a relevant subclass of a
               Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::BaseVariationFeatureOverlapAllele object according to 
               feature types it is interested in, as specified by the plugin's feature_types method:
               
                feature type         argument type

                'Transcript'         Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::TranscriptVariationAllele
                'RegulatoryFeature'  Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::RegulatoryFeatureVariationAllele
                'MotifFeature'       Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::MotifFeatureVariationAllele

               Once the plugin has done its analysis it should return the results as a hashref
               with a key for each type of data (which should match the keys described in 
               get_header_info) and a corresponding value for this particular object, or an empty 
               hash (*not* undef) if this plugin does not produce any annotation for this object. 
               Any edata will then be included in the Extra column in the VEP output file. 
               Please refer to the variation API documentation to see what methods are available 
               on each of the possible classes, bearing in mind that common functionality can be 
               found in the BaseVariationFeatureOverlapAllele superclass. 
               
               If the plugin wants to filter this line out of the VEP output it can indicate
               this by returning undef rather than a hashref. Using this mechanism a plugin
               can act as a filter on the VEP output to limit lines to particular events
               of interest. If you are writing a plugin to act as filter, consider subclassing
               Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::Utils::BaseVepFilterPlugin, a subclass of this class
               which provides some convenient functionality for filter plugins.

  Returntype : hashref or undef if the plugin wants to filter out this line
