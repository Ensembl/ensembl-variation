=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::Utils::BaseVepFilterPlugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # a simple example filter plugin that excludes all
    # lines that are not non-synonymous changes (defined
    # as those which have alternate peptides in their
    # pep_allele_string)

    package NonSynonymousFilter;

    use base qw(Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::Utils::BaseVepFilterPlugin);

    sub feature_types {
        return ['Transcript'];
    }

    sub include_line {
        my ($self, $tva) = @_;
        
        if (my $pep_alleles = $tva->pep_allele_string) {
            return $pep_alleles =~ /\//;
        }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a subclass of BaseVepPlugin aimed to make plugins that act like
filters very straightforward to write. Users should subclass this module
and then need only override the include_line method which should return
a true value if the current line should be included, or a false value
to filter the line out. A filter can then be used with the VEP just as
any other plugin by using the --plugin <module name> command line option.

  Arg[1]     : An instance of a subclass of Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::VariationFeatureOverlapAllele
  Arg[2]     : A hashref containing all the data that will be printed on this line, keyed by column name
  Description: This method should return true if the plugin wants to filter out this line and
               false otherwise.
  Returntype : boolean
  Status     : Experimental
