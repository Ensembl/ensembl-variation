=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::Utils::ComparaUtils

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module exports two subroutines, dump_alignment_for_polyphen and
dump_alignment_for_sift that write Compara alignments to files in the 
formats expected by PolyPhen and SIFT. This allows you to use
Compara alignments in place of both these tools' alignment pipelines
