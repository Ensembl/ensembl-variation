# Ensembl module for Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::ReadCoverage
#
#


=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::ReadCoverage - A coverage reagion for a read.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Read coverage feature representing a genomic region covered by 1 read

    $rc = Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::ReadCoverage->new
       (-start   => 100,
        -end     => 200,
        -slice   => $slice,
        -level   => 1.
        -sample  => $sample);

    $rc = $rc->transform('supercontig');

    print $rc->start(), "-", $rc->end(), "\n";


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a class representing the read coverage information
from the ensembl-variation database. A ReadCoverage behaves as any other Ensembl feature.

See B<Bio::EnsEMBL::Feature>.

  Arg [-ADAPTOR] :
    see superclass constructor

  Arg [-START] :
    see superclass constructor
  Arg [-END] :
    see superclass constructor
  Arg [-SLICE] :
    see superclass constructor

  Arg [-LEVEL] :
