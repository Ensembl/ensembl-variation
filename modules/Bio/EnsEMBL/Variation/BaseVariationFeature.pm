=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::BaseVariationFeature - Abstract base class for variation features

=head1 SYNOPSIS

None

=head1 DESCRIPTION

directly.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 consequence_type

  Arg [1]    : (optional) String $term_type
  Description: Get a list of all the unique consequence terms of this 
               VariationFeature. By default returns Ensembl display terms
               (e.g. 'NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING'). $term_type can also be 'label'
               (e.g. 'Non-synonymous coding'), 'SO' (Sequence Ontology, e.g.
               'non_synonymous_codon') or 'NCBI' (e.g. 'missense')
  Returntype : listref of strings
  Exceptions : none
  Status     : Stable

=head2 display_consequence

  Arg [1]    : (optional) String $term_type
  Description: Get the term for the most severe consequence of this 
               VariationFeature. By default returns Ensembl display terms
               (e.g. 'NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING'). $term_type can also be 'label'
               (e.g. 'Non-synonymous coding'), 'SO' (Sequence Ontology, e.g.

}

=head2 most_severe_OverlapConsequence

  Description: Get the OverlapConsequence considered (by Ensembl) to be the most severe 
               consequence of all the alleles of this VariationFeature 
  Returntype : Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::OverlapConsequence
  Exceptions : none
