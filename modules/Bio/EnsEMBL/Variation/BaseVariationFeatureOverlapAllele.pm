=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::BaseVariationFeatureOverlapAllele

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::BaseVariationFeatureOverlapAllele;
    
    my $bvfoa = Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::BaseVariationFeatureOverlapAllele->new(
        -base_variation_feature_overlap => $bvfo,
        -is_reference                   => 0,
    );

    print "consequence SO terms: ", (join ",", map { $_->SO_term } @{ $bvfoa->get_all_OverlapConsequences }), "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A BaseVariationFeatureOverlapAllele object represents a single allele of a 
BaseVariationFeatureOverlap. It is the super-class of variation feature specific
classes such as VariationFeatureOverlapAllele and StructuralVariationOverlapAllele 
and contains methods not specific to any particular variation feature type. 
Ordinarily you will not create these objects yourself, but instead you would 
create one of the more specific subclasses.
