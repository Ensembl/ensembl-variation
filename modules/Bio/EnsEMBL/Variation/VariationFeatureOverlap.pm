=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::VariationFeatureOverlap

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::VariationFeatureOverlap;

  my $vfo = Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::VariationFeatureOverlap->new(
    -feature      => $feature,
    -variation_feature  => $var_feat
  );

  print "consequence type: ", (join ",", @{ $vfo->consequence_type }), "\n";
  print "most severe consequence: ", $vfo->display_consequence, "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A VariationFeatureOverlap represents a VariationFeature which is in close
proximity to another Ensembl Feature. It is the superclass of feature-specific
objects such as TranscriptVariation and RegulatoryFeatureVariation, and has
methods common to all such objects. You will not normally instantiate this
class directly, instead instantiating one of the feature-specific subclasses.

=head2 new

  Arg [-FEATURE] : 
  The Bio::EnsEMBL::Feature associated with the given VariationFeature

  Arg [-VARIATION_FEATURE] :
  The Bio::EnsEMBL::VariationFeature associated with the given Feature

  Arg [-ADAPTOR] :
  A Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::DBSQL::VariationFeatureOverlapAdaptor

  Arg [-DISAMBIGUATE_SINGLE_NUCLEOTIDE_ALLELES] :
  A flag indiciating if ambiguous single nucleotide alleles should be disambiguated
  when constructing the VariationFeatureOverlapAllele objects, e.g. a Variationfeature
  with an allele string like 'T/M' would be treated as if it were 'T/A/C'. We limit
  ourselves to single nucleotide alleles to avoid the combinatorial explosion if we
  allowed longer alleles with potentially many ambiguous bases.

  Example : 
  my $vfo = Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::VariationFeatureOverlap->new(
    -feature       => $feature,
    -variation_feature => $var_feat
  );

  Description: Constructs a new VariationFeatureOverlap instance given a VariationFeature
         and a Feature
  Returntype : A new Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::VariationFeatureOverlap instance 
  Exceptions : throws unless both VARIATION_FEATURE and FEATURE are supplied, or if the
         supplied ADAPTOR is the wrong class
  Status   : Stable
