    $reg->load_registry_from_db(-host => 'ensembldb.ensembl.org',-user => 'anonymous');
  
    my $rfa  = $reg->get_adaptor('human', 'funcgen', 'RegulatoryFeature');
    my $va   = $reg->get_adaptor('human', 'variation', 'Variation');
    my $vfa  = $reg->get_adaptor('human', 'variation', 'VariationFeature');
    my $rfva = $reg->get_adaptor('human','variation','RegulatoryFeatureVariation');

    # fetch RegulatoryFeature by dbID
    my $rf_stable_id = 'ENSR00000316845';
    my $rf           = $rfa->fetch_by_stable_id($rf_stable_id);

    # fetch all RegulatoryFeatureVariations falling in the MotifFeature
    my $rfvs = $rfva->fetch_all_by_RegulatoryFeatures([$rf]);

    # fetch by VariationFeatures
    my $variation_name = 'rs191666497';
    my $v   = $va->fetch_by_name($variation_name);
    my $vfs = $vfa->fetch_all_by_Variation($v);
    
    # fetch all RegulatoryFeatureVariations for the list of VariationFeatures
    for my $vf (@$vfs) {

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This adaptor allows you to fetch RegulatoryFeatureVariation objects either by the RegulatoryFeature
the associated VariationFeature falls in, or by VariationFeature directly. Storing
RegulatoryFeatureVariation objects in a variation schema database is also supported. In the
database there will a separate row for each alternative allele of a RegulatoryFeatureVariation, 
but the methods here will fetch all alleles associated with the RegulatoryFeatureVariation
at once.
