=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::DBSQL::VariationFeatureOverlapAdaptor

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the superclass of all Adaptors that fetch VariationFeatureOverlap
objects and their various subclasses, and it provides methods common to
all such adaptors, such as fetching by VariationFeature. You should not
generally use this class directly, but instead use one of the feature
specific adaptors such as the TranscriptVariationAdaptor.
