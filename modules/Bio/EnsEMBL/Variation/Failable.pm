=head2 failed_description

  Arg [1]    : $failed_description (optional)
               The new value to set the failed_description attribute to. Should 
               be a reference to a list of strings, alternatively a string can
               be passed. If multiple failed descriptions are specified, they should
               be separated with semi-colons.  
  Example    : $failed_str = $sv->failed_description();
  Description: Get/Sets the failed description for this variant. The failed
               descriptions are lazy-loaded from the database.
  Returntype : String (semi-colon separated)
  Exceptions : Thrown on illegal argument.
  Caller     : general
  Status     : Stable

  Example    : print "Structural variant '" . $sv->variation_name() . "' has " . ($sv->is_failed() ? "" : "not ") . "been flagged as failed\n";
