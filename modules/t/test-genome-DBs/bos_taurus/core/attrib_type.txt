427	appris	APPRIS	APPRIS is a system that deploys a range of computational methods to provide value to the annotations of the human genome. APPRIS also selects one of the CDS for each gene as the principal isoform. APPRIS defines the principal variant by combining protein structural and functional information and information from the conservation of related species. principal1 - APPRIS principal isoform. principal2 - APPRIS candidate isoform (CCDS). principal3 - APPRIS candidate isoform (earliest CCDS). principal4 - APPRIS candidate isoform (longest CCDS). principal5 - APPRIS candidate isoform (longest coding sequence). alternative1 - APPRIS candidate isoform that is conserved in at least three tested species. alternative2 - APPRIS candidate isoform that appears to be conserved in fewer than three tested species
444	noncoding_cnt_m	Misc non coding genes	Number of unclassified (miscellaneous) non coding genes
