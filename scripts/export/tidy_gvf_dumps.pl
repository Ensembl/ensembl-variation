__DATA__
This directory contains a gzip compressed GVF (Genome Variation Format) file
containing all germline variations from the current Ensembl release for this 
species, named %s.gvf.gz. If this species has any structural 
variation data this is provided in a file named 
%s_structural_variations.gvf.gz

Any variations that have been failed by the Ensembl QC checks will be included
in a file called %s_failed.gvf.gz.

A file including the consequences of the variations on the Ensembl transcriptome, 
as called by the variation consequence pipeline, can be found in a file called 
%s_incl_consequences.gvf.gz.

For human we also provide a file containing all somatic mutations in the
database, files with germline variations observed in the Watson and Venter 
genomes along with their genotypes, and files containing allele frequencies
from several of the HapMap and 1000 genomes pilot study populations.

Please note that depending on the amount of variation data available for this 
species the uncompressed file may be very large (e.g. the entire germline file 
for human is ~3GB and the file including consequences is ~9GB).

The data contained in these files is presented in GVF format, this is a
simple tab-delimited format derived from GFF3 which shows the location of 
each variant along with the reference and variant sequences, an identifier 
for the source of the data (typically a dbSNP rsID), and other relevant 
information (e.g. genotypes, allele frequencies, the predicted effect of 
this variant on a transcript), a short example is presented below. For 
more details about GVF please refer to:

Genome Biology. 2010;11(8):R88 PMID: 20796305

and:

Questions about these files can be addressed to the Ensembl helpdesk: 
http://www.ensembl.org/Help/Contact, or to the developer's mailing list: http://lists.ensembl.org/mailman/listinfo/dev.
