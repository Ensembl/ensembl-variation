This directory contains scripts which can be used to import ancestral allele data to a variation database.
The scripts fetch the ancestral allele for each variation in the variation table and write it to the
ancestral_allele column in the variation table.

The ancestral allele data comes from Ensembl compara
(http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/compara/analyses.html#ancestral) and is based on a 6 way primate alignment.
Currently, there are ancestral genomes for gorilla, human, macaque, orangutan and chimpanzee.
They can be downloaded from:
ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-66/fasta/ancestral_alleles/


Prerequisites for running the scripts are:
 - A variation database with data in variation and variation_feature tables
 - Ancestral genome in fasta file format

The following three scripts have to be run in a row. Use the --help argument to get
further information on the required arguments:
 - ancestral_allele_pre_processing.pl [arguments]
 - parallel_ancestral_allele_calling.pl [arguments]
 - ancestral_allele_post_processing.pl [arguments] 

More information about what is going on behind the curtains: 
PRE_PROCESSING
	All variation features are fetched from the variation database. BioPerl Bio::DB::Fasta is used to build indexes
	over fasta sequences (ancestral genome) locally which provides fast random access to the data. To speed up computation
	fasta files are divided into sets of sequence regions and than an index is build over each set of sequence regions.
	The devision depends on the coverage with variation features: The count of variation features for each region is 
	computed. Based on these counts a load balancing schema is computed: Divide sequence regions with regard to number
	of variation features over n processes. Fetch variation features save in a file. Divide fasta files accorindly.

PARALLEL_ANCESTRAL_ALLELE_CALLING
	The computation of ancestral alleles can be done in parallel: The input is a file with all the variation features
	for a set of sequence regions and the according fasta files for those sequences.
	
	For each variation feature the anancestral is fetched from the ancstral allele genome:
	Different cases need to be considered:
 		- currently insertions cannot be considered
 		- deletions of size > 50 bp are not considered
 		- reverse sequence if it is from the minus strand
	Save results to file.

POST_PROCESSING
	The variation features need to be sorted by variation_id. The sorting is done in a temporary database. Ancestral alleles
	having the same variation_id are consolidated: An ancestral allele is only assigned to a variation if it is the same over
	all variation_features of that variation. In a final step the ancestral_allele column is updated.
